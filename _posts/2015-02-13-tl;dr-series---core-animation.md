In order to get back into writing every other week, I am planning a new series of post. These posts are titled TL;DR Series. Each post will give a basic gist of a topic at the top. The post will have a more detailed look into the topic below the TL;DR. I am trying to keep the TL;DR section pretty concise so it would answer quick questions that comes up on the said topic. 

Initially I plan to write about Core Animation. I plan to branch out into other areas if I find some interesting topics. If you have any specific suggestions on topics, please let me know and I will try to address them.
