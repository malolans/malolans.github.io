## Projects
### [Rizon App](http://www.rizonapp.co)

Over the last six months, I have been working with [Sam King](https://twitter.com/samkingphoto), a designer, on an app for Photographers called Rizon. 

* Rizon is a Golden Hour companion, helping you find out the golden hour at any location. 
* With offline support, you can look up golden hour information for any day in the future from any location. 
* Rizon also offers nifty little reminders before the golden hour. Get it on the [App Store](bit.ly/RizonAppStore)

The Dish for CMU is an app for students at Carnegie Mellon University to instantly find open restaurants and stores around the campus.

* An intuitive time line for the stores and restaurants around the campus.
